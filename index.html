                    Python is a popular high-level programming language. It is a general-purpose language used by
                    scientists, developers, and many others who want to work more quickly and integrate systems
                    more effectively.

                <p>
                    Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers post-secondary students an
                    opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period.

                    The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is an organization devoted to advancing open source
                    technology related to the Python programming language.
                    Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has participated in Google Summer of Code, serving
                    as an "umbrella organization" to a variety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring
                    projects related to the development of the Python language. Python provides mentors, Google
                    provides the program (and the money!), and students write code!

                <p>
                    There's hundreds of thousands of projects that use Python, and you
                    need to narrow
                    down the list before you can get help or do much that's useful. See <a href="faq.html#choosing">How
                        do I choose a project or sub-org?</a> for ideas
                    on how to do that.


                    <p><em>Any</em> open source experience will help you prepare for GSoC,
                        so don't worry too much about what project you try first and don't be afraid
                        to change your mind! When we know which sub-orgs will be participating,
                        they'll be listed <a href="ideas.html">with the project ideas</a>.

                    Join the mailing list, IRC channel, or any other communication
                    channels the developers use. Listen, get to know the people involved, and ask
                    questions.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Read first to see if your question has already been answered.

                        </li>
                        <li>Communicate in public (not in private). Most open source work is done in the open, so
                            demonstrate that you can do that!</li>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Many projects have these tagged as "easy" "bite-size" or
                    "beginner-friendly" -- do a search to see what comes up. Competition for the easiest
                    ones can be fierce, so don't be afraid to try something harder if you think
                    you might know what to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can't find a bug? Other ideas: find typos and fix them. Improve test coverage by
                    writing new tests. Improve documentation. Use a tool like Pylint or Bandit to see
                    if you can find new issues.

                <h3>How do I apply?</h3>

                Short application checklist:
                <ol>
                    <li>Read the links and instructions given on this site -- All of it! we've tried to give you all
                        the information you need to be an awesome student applicant.

                    <li>Choose a sub-org (<a href="#ideas">check the list here</a>). Applications not
                        associated with a sub-org typically get rejected.

                    <li>Talk to your prospective mentors about what they expect of student
                        applicants and get help from them to refine your project ideas. Listening to
                        your mentors' recommendations is very important at this stage!</li>

                    <li>Prepare a patch for that sub-org. Usually we expect students to fix a bug and have made a pull
                        request (or equivalent). Your code doesn't have to be
                        accepted and merged, but it does have to be visible to the public.</li>

                    <li><a href="studenttemplate.html">Write your application</a> (with help from your mentors!). <a
                            href="https://github.com/python-gsoc/python-gsoc.github.io/blob/master/2018/application2018.md">A
                            shorter
                            markdown version of the application template is available here.</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use a descriptive title and include your sub-org name. Good example: "Mailman:
                                Improve
                                archive search" Bad example: "My gsoc project"
                            <li>Make it easy for your mentors to give you feedback. If you're using Google docs,
                                enable comments and submit a "draft" (we can't see the "final" versions until applications close).
                                If you're using a format that doesn't accept comments, make sure your email is on the document and don't forget to check for
                                feedback!
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li> Submit your application to Google before the deadline. We actually
                        recommend you submit a few days early in case you have internet problems or
                        the system is down. Google does not extend this deadline, so it's best to be
                        prepared early! You can edit your application up until the system
                        closes.</li>

                    <p><strong>Communication</strong> is probably the most
                    important part of the application process. Talk to the mentors and other
                    developers, <em>listen</em> when they give you advice,
                    and demonstrate that you've understood by incorporating their feedback into
                    what you're proposing. We reject a lot of students who haven't listened to mentor
                    feedback.  If your mentors tell you that a project idea won't work for them, you're
                    probably not going to get accepted unless you change it.</p>

                    Tips!
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Read first.</strong> We've tried to answer the common questions on this site, and
                        we get asked things like "<a href="#getstarted">how do I get started?</a>" and "<a href="faq.html#easybugs">where
                            do I find easy bugs?</a>" a lot. Check the <a href="faq.html">Frequently Asked
                            Questions (FAQ)</a> for more!</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Patient!</strong> Our mentors typically have day jobs and can't always answer
                        right-away. If you can't hang out on IRC for an answer, send an email instead.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask questions directly on IRC.</strong> You don't need to introduce
                        yourself or say hi first, just ask away!</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate in public.</strong> That lets many mentors read your question so you
                        can usually get an answer faster.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>For mentors</strong>: All the gsoc admins can be reached at
                    gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org if you have questions about participating.
                    (Students should email gsoc-general(at)python.org with all of their
                    questions, unless they are of a sensitive personal nature.)
