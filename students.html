            <p>GSoC is basically an open source apprenticeship: students will be paid by
                Google to work under the guidance of mentors from an open source community.
                It's a really great opportunity to build new skills, make connections in your
                community, get experience working with a larger and often distributed team,
                learn, and, of course, get paid.</p>

            <p>Students are expected to work around 40 hours a week on their GSoC project.
                This is essentially a full-time job. Ideally, you should not attempt to do
                another internship, job, or full-time schooling while you're doing GSoC.</p>

            <p>Remember that Google intends this to be a way for new contributors to join
                the world of open source. The students most likely to be selected are those
                who are engaged with the community and hoping to continue their involvement
                for more than just a few months.</p>

            <p>To apply, you need to <a href="#ideas">take a look at the mentoring
                    organizations and the ideas that they are willing to sponsor</a>. Typically,
                you'll choose one of their ideas and work with a mentor to create a project
                proposal that's good for both you and your chosen open source community.
                Sometimes, projects are open to new ideas from students, but if you propose
                something new make especially sure that you work with a mentor to make sure
                it's a good fit for your community. Unsolicited, undiscussed ideas are less
                likely to get accepted.</p>

            <p>Note that Python is an "umbrella organization" which means that our team is
                actually a group of python projects that work together to do Google Summer of
                Code. If you're going to apply with us, you'll need to choose from one of
                those teams, because that defines which mentors will be helping you with your
                applications. <strong>Applications without any sub-org and mentor to
                    evaluate them will be rejected.</strong> You can work with more than one
                sub-org while you're figuring out what you want to do, but you can only
                accept one job offer.</p>

                <h2 class="content-head is-center">How do I choose a project or sub-org?</h2>
                <p>Choosing a project is a pretty personal choice. You should choose something you want to
                    work on, and none of us can tell you exactly what that would be! But here's a few
                    questions you might want to ask yourself to help figure that out:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What software do you already use?</strong> If you use the software, you know a lot more
                        about
                        it and probably have stronger opinions about what would make it better!

                    <li><strong>What would you like to learn?</strong> GSoC is meant to be a bit of a learning
                        opportunity.
                        Have you always wanted to be more involved with biology? Astronomy? Mathematics?
                        Education? See which projects might help you improve your skills.

                    <li><strong>Who do you like working with?</strong> Hang out where the developers do and get to know
                        some of
                        your potential mentors. Which developers inspire you?

                    <li><strong>How do you want to change the world?</strong> Do you want to help people learn more?
                        Communicate better? Understand our world better? Lots of python projects can help you do
                        social good!

                    <li><strong>How do you like to communicate?</strong> Do you like realtime communication on IRC?
                        Perhaps you
                        should choose a project with mentors close to you in time zone. Do you like asynchronous
                        communication on mailing lists? Find a group with active lists. Communication is a big
                        part of summer of code (or really any open source development in a team) to finding a team
                        that works the way you want to work can make your summer more awesome.
                </ul>

                <p>There's a list of sub-orgs for this year and for previous years linked <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode">here</a>
                    Be aware that all sub orgs might not be able to participate every year, and make sure to
                    check and see if they're planning to participate before assuming.</p>

                <p><strong>If you're chosen as a GSoC student, you're going to be expected to make some decisions
                        on
                        your own, so you can make a better first impression on mentors by showing that you're able
                        to narrow down your field of choices!</strong></p>
            </div>

    <a name="knowledge"></a>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-1 pure-u-lg-1-1">
            <h2 class="content-head content-head is-center">What do I need to know to participate in Summer of Code
                with Python?</h2>

            <p>The answer to this depends a lot on the project you choose. We have a range of projects,
                from beginner to advanced. Each of the sub orgs expects different things from their
                students: maybe you'll need to know a bit about machine learning, or email, or image
                processing. The answer to this question is always <strong>ask your mentors what you will need to
                    know for a specific project.</strong></p>

            <p>But a lot of people ask early on because they want to be sort of generically ready but
                they're not sure what they want to do yet, so that's not always super helpful.</p>

            <p>So here's a list of a few things that are useful for most Python umbrella projects:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>You need to have a bit of experience with Python.</strong> You can be a
                    beginner, but
                    practicing in advance is good! And there are a lot more projects available for students
                    who are reasonably used to the language, so more practice means you'll have more
                    project
                    options.

                <li><strong>You need to feel comfortable asking questions</strong>, because we're going to
                    expect you to
                    ask if you don't understand something.

                <li><strong>You should be comfortable communicating your ideas to others in
                        public.</strong> Most projects
                    have public mailing lists and would prefer if you use them, and Python students will
                    also
                    be asked to blog about their work over the summer. You can use a pseudonym (nickname)
                    if
                    that works best for you. Google will need to know who you are to pay you, but we just
                    need something to call you.

                <li><strong>You probably want some experience with version control.</strong> We have a lot
                    of projects that
                    use different tools, such as git, mercurial, or bzr, and you can find out which one
                    your
                    project uses in advance and practice using it on your schoolwork or personal projects
                    to
                    get used to it.

                <li><strong>You might like to take a bit of time to read <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">the
                            python style guide,
                            PEP8</a>.</strong> Not every
                    project uses these rules, but they can give you a rough idea of what is considered
                    "readable code" by most pythonistas. (And for fun, you might want to read the poetry of
                    <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">PEP20 "The Zen of Python"</a>)

                    What should I do if no one answers my question?</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Be patient.</strong> If you're on IRC, stick around for an hour or so (you can do
                        something else,
                        just leave the IRC window open and check back occasionally) and see if someone gets back
                        to you. If they don't, try posting to the mailing list (it's possible all the developers
                        are asleep!) If you're on a mailing list, you should give people around 24-48h to answer
                        before worrying too much about it.</li>

                    <li><strong>Make sure you're asking in the best place.</strong> One common mistake students make is
                        to contact
                        individual developers rather than asking on a public mailing list or a public IRC channel.
                        You want as many people as possible to see your questions, so try not to be shy! (and
                        don't worry about looking too much like a newbie -- all of us were new once!) Sometimes
                        projects have different lists/irc channels/forums/bug queues for different types of
                        questions. If you're not sure, do feel free to follow up your question with something like
                        "hey, I haven't gotten an answer on this... is there somewhere better I could post it or
                        more information you need to help?"</li>

                    <li><strong>Try giving more information.</strong> If you've hit a bug, try to give the error
                        message and
                        information about your setup and information about what you've already tried. If you're
                        trying to find a bit of documentation, indicate where you've already looked. And again
                        "hey, I haven't got an answer... what other information could I provide to help debug this
                        problem?" is a reasonable follow-up if you're not sure what people might need.</li>

                    <li><strong>If you're really having trouble getting in touch with your mentors, talk to the Python
                            org
                            admins by emailing gsoc-admins(at)python.org</strong> The Python org admins should have
                        contact
                        info for mentors with each project and can help connect you. (Note: please don't complain
                        that you can't get in touch with us on the general google lists or #gsoc. They're just
                        going to redirect you to Terri and the other python org admins anyhow!)

            <p>If you want to make the best first impression, <strong>DO NOT start emails with "Dear
                    Sir."</strong> Python
                has many mentors who are female and/or prefer other forms of address. We realize you're
                trying to be polite, but "Dear Sir" is often perceived in our communities as alienating,
                rude or simply too formal and off-putting.</p>

            <p>Try "Dear developers" or "Dear mentors" if you're sending a general email. If you're
                addressing a specific person, use the name or nickname that they use on their emails.
                Culturally speaking, first names or chosen nicknames are fine for most open source
                projects.

                <p>You'll hear this phrase sometimes on IRC, and it means "please just ask your question,
                    don't say something like 'can I ask a question?' first."</p>

                <p>Why? Developers are often pretty busy, and if you just ask the question, someone can jump
                    in the minute they see your message with the answer or direct you to folk who can answer
                    it better.</p>

                <p>If you ask "can I ask a question?" you're basically just waiting for someone to say "yes"
                    before any useful information is communicated. Many folk consider this slow, annoying, and
                    perhaps even rude. Save everyone (including yourself!) some time and just ask the question
                    right from the start. Culturally speaking, in open source projects it's generally ok
                    launch right in to a question on IRC; you don't even have to say hi first!</p>

            <h2 class="content-head content-head is-center">How many slots does python get? How many slots does project
                $x get?</h2>

            <p>We don't know our slot allocation until Google announces them, and google bases their
                numbers on the number of students we tell them we want. The more great applications we
                have, the more slots we'll request. So rather than worrying about the number of slots, you
                should be aiming to be such a memorable and great prospective student that your sub-org
                will definitely request a slot with you in mind. </p>

            <p>For sub-orgs, new groups working with us usually get 1-2 slots, experienced sub-orgs may
                be granted as many as they can comfortably mentor at the discretion of the org admins.
                (The max number will likely be close to the total number of mentors divided by two, but
                the actual number requested depends on which students the org specifically wants to hire
                after they've done an initial review of the applications.)</p>

            <p>Google has been incredibly generous with letting us have slots in previous years, so we
                are usually more limited by the matching of mentors with truly excellent students. We've
                had as many as 70 or fewer than 20 depending on the quality of student applications.</p>

            <p>If we get 100 applications and 50 of them
                are excellent, we'll try to find enough mentors for 50 students. If only 5 of them are excellent,
                then we'll be sad but we'll only request 5 slots and most of our mentors would take the year off.
                Sometimes whole sub-orgs take the year off because they have no excellent students. (and yes,
                if every single application we got was amazing we'd try to find a way to mentor all those students.)</p>

            <p>He’s just like that! It's actually an incredibly important job: his job is to say no when
                things aren’t ready, so we can go back and make things more awesome. It's also his job to
                make sure that Terri's workload is reasonable, and that means saying NO pretty frequently.
                All those no’s make it possible to run this program every year!
